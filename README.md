#ChessSDL2
To run the game, you need to add and link SDL2 libraries to the project. In case you're not familiar with it,
there is a link with a short YouTube video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrDdfALWH_4.

// Personal note
It was a project for my IT class in the 1st semester. I do realize it's far from perfect, has many shortcomings, and there are many things that I would do differently this time around because I've learned so much during this project and even more since I finished it. But it's my latest big project, which I'm proud of nonetheless.
